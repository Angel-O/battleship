4. email Carsten about Ocean.hasSunkShipAt method specs
5. Ocean.getShipArray return actual ships...what are they???
7. check nesting in print method
10. rotate matrix strategy: can I use it in the ocean class?
11. remove unnecessary code from test classes, fix names...
12. improve re-usability of tests method by scanning ocean by type
16. is there a limit to the number of attempts to place a ship?
18. add comments to private mehods in test classes, what about actual test methods?
19. move diagonal check to its own method to squash lateral and end check in a unique method
20. remove initalize ocean method
22. double check edge cases are tested
23. remove for loops from test methods if possible
24. placeShipsOntoOcean method: remove shipLength parameter and restore method to get ship length from ship type
so that passing the wrong length value for a particular ship type is less likey to happen
25. go through all assertion messages in test classes
26. add comments on github
27. remove random generator in test classes as it is not advisable unless strictly needed: what if we change the code
due to some requiremnts change and some tests suddenly fail, but we don't know what values made them fail?
