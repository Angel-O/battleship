10. added padding strategy: can I use it in the test class?
11. remove unnecessary code from test classes, fix names...
12. improve re-usability of tests method by scanning ocean by type
16. is there a limit to the number of attempts to place a ship?
18. add comments to private mehods in test classes, what about actual test methods?
22. double check edge cases are tested
24. placeShipsOntoOcean method: remove shipLength parameter and restore method to get ship length from ship type
so that passing the wrong length value for a particular ship type is less likey to happen
26. add comments on github
30. remove setup test methods if not used
31. if any ship is adjecenct to another ship diagonally you will have at least an occupied location
to the (top)right or to the (bottom)left of the ocean cell before the bow (or after the stern)
of the ship...would this be a clearer way to test the diagonal adjecency?
32. have another think about the emptysea being created in cretaeship method
33. add edge cases to ship.shootAt method
